### About
* This repository contains my review of the paper [What Does BERT Look At? An Analysis of BERT's Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04341).
* Further, using the codebase referenced below, I have performed analysis on a sample dataset consisting of restaurant reviews, and have listed my observations.
